# BME AI Studio Data Folder

This folder contains essential files and scripts related to the configuration, data logging, and processing for projects using the Nicla BME2 hardware. Below is a description of the folder structure and the purpose of each file.

## File Descriptions

### 1. **DataLogs/**
This directory contains raw or processed data logs collected from the Nicla BME2 device during various experiments or testing sessions. 

### 2. **Nicla_BME2.bmeproject**
Initial project folder. It contains some useful data, information and algorithms.

### 3. **Nicla_BME2V2.bmeproject**
This is an updated version of the initial `Nicla_BME2.bmeproject`. It contains a lot of similar information, some newer updated ones, and better formatting. 

### 4. **Specimen**
A folder of preconfigured BME data that can be directly imported into AI studio without individual importing and labelling for ease of use. However, the original datalog is still here as a reference and data validation. 

### 5. **BSEC2DataLogConverter.py**
The provided Python script converts the raw data logs the Nicla and Putty generated to an AI Usable format. Originally prepackaged within the BHY2 library, it is moved here for ease of access
.
### 6. **NiclaBME_HP-354.bmeconfig**
Preconfigured the Heating Profile used and can be used with the default HP of the Nicla code. It is needed for the log converter to convert log to usable data by studio

## Usage Instructions
1. **Data Logging:** Putty was used to log the Serial data from the Nicla and store the log files in the `DataLogs` folder. (Individually named to reduce confusion)
2. **Configuration:** {name}.bmeproject is a database for storing data and algorithms. Either could be used or a new one generated by BME_AI_Studio
3. **Data Conversion:** Run `BSEC2DataLogConverter.py` to convert logs from `DataLogs/` into the required format for further analysis.
4. **Configurations:** Ensure that the heat profile uploaded is the same as the one configured `NiclaBME_HP-354.bmeconfig` to ensure data matches heating cycles

## Notes
- The `Specimen/` folder contains pre-configured and annotated samples from logs to reduce the work needed for reproducibility
- Always back up the original configurations before making modifications.
