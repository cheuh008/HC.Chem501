# BME AI Studio Data Folder

This folder contains essential files and scripts related to the configuration, data logging, and processing for projects using the Nicla BME2 hardware. Below is a description of the folder structure and the purpose of each file.

## File Descriptions

### 1. **DataLogs/**
This directory contains raw or processed data logs collected from the Nicla BME2 device during various experiments or testing sessions. These logs are essential for analysing environmental data and validating configurations.

### 2. **Nicla_BME2.bmeproject**
This is the initial project configuration file for the Nicla BME2 device. It contains the settings and parameters required to set up and run experiments or simulations using BME AI Studio.

### 3. **Nicla_BME2V2.bmeproject**
This file is an updated version of the `Nicla_BME2.bmeproject`. It includes revisions and optimisations, providing an enhanced configuration for more accurate data collection or processing.

### 4. **Specimen/**
This directory may house additional experimental data or specific configurations related to individual specimens or test cases. It is typically used for maintaining detailed logs or metadata.

### 5. **BSEC2DataLogConverter.py**
This Python script converts raw data logs generated by the Nicla to an AI Studio Usable format.

### 6. **NiclaBME_HP-354.bmeconfig**
Customised config file for the Heating Profile used, needed for the log converter to convert log to usable data by studio

## Usage Instructions
1. **Data Logging:** Putty was used to log the Serial data from the Nicla and store the log files in the `DataLogs` folder. (Individually named to reduce confusion)
2. **Configuration:** {name}.bmeproject is a database for storing data and algorithms. Either could be used or a new one generated by BME_AI_Studio
3. **Data Conversion:** Run `BSEC2DataLogConverter.py` to convert logs from `DataLogs/` into the required format for further analysis.
4. **Configurations:** Ensure that the heat profile uploaded is the same as the one configured `NiclaBME_HP-354.bmeconfig` to ensure data matches heating cycles

## Notes
- The `Specimen/` folder contains pre configgeured and annoated samples from logs to reduce work needed for reproducibility
- Always back up the original configurations before making modifications.
